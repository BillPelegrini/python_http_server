# Simple HTTP Server in Python

This is a basic example demonstrating how to create a simple HTTP server in Python using the `http.server` library. In this example, the server listens on port 8080 and responds to any request with the body "Hello, World!".

### Script Details
The script utilizes the http.server library and defines a class named HelloHandler, which inherits from BaseHTTPRequestHandler. The do_GET method is overridden to send an HTTP response with the body "Hello, World!".

```python
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class HelloHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b'Hello, World!')

httpd = HTTPServer(('', 8080), HelloHandler)
httpd.serve_forever()
```
You can expand this example to perform more advanced operations, such as processing request data, sending specific headers, or integrating frameworks like Flask or Django for easier development.

Feel free to explore and customize the script as needed to meet your requirements.

## How to Use

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can run the script as follows:

```bash
python http_server.py
